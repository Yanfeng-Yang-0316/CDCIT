# CDCIT
This is the source code of **Conditional Diffusion Models Based Conditional Independence Testing** (CDCIT) acceepted by AAAI 2025. Our algorithm can test the conditional independence between random variable $X$, $Y$ given $Z$, i.e.  

$H_0: X тлл Y|Z  \text{ \quad v.s. \quad }  H_1:X \not тлл Y|Z,$  

which is a important problem in statistics, machine learning and causal structure learning.


## Environment Requirements
numpy==1.23.5  
pandas==2.2.0

## Usage
There is detailed description of function **perform_diffusion_crt()** in diffusion_crt.py. Show_case.ipynb also provides the usage.
